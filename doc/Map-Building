RoadMap Map Building 

January 2009


= Building Maps =

     To build the TIGER map files from scratch:

     + download some maps from the US Census bureau:

           http://www.census.gov/geo/www/tiger/tiger2006se/tgr2006se.html

     This download can be automated by using the shell script
     roadmap/src/rdmdownload:

```
        rdmdownload <tiger-path> [<state-symbol> ..]
```

     (To download older versions of the maps (e.g.  2000), see the
     script for the options available.)

     + Build the maps:

```
        rdmgenmaps <tiger-path> maps=<map-path>
```

     This command processes all the Census Bureau files found in <tiger-path>
     and creates the map files for RoadMap in the <map-path> directory.
     There is one map file generated for each county.  Alternately, specific
     counties can be built.  Counties are identified by their FIPS codes
     (e.g. 06075 for San Francisco, CA).

```
        rdmgenmaps <tiger-path> [maps=<map-path>] <county fips code> ..
```

     The rdmgenmaps command can also process one full state at a time:

```
        rdmgenmaps <tiger-path> maps=<map-path> <two-letter state abbreviation>
```

     The rdmgenmaps tool is a shell script that extracts the TIGER files from
     the downloaded ZIP files, invokes the buildmap tool and then cleans up
     the TIGER files.  Last, rdmgenmaps invokes the buildus tool to generate
     the US states and counties catalog.  The main purpose of rdmgenmaps is
     really to keep the TIGER files in compressed form, considering their
     huge size..

     The buildmap tool is the worker program used by rdmgenmaps.  It
     takes a county "FIPS" code and a TIGER file as input and produces one
     RoadMap .rdm map file.  The option --help gives more information about
     the available options.

     Here is an example:

```
        buildmap 01001 /tmp/TGR01001.RT1
```

     The buildus tool creates a catalog of maps that is used by RoadMap
     to combine all states and counties into a giant US map.


= Map Utilities =

   RoadMap comes with a small set of utility programs and scripts which
   are used to build and maintain the map data files that roadmap uses.

   : buildmap
       buildmap takes various input map formats as input and
       produces the map files used by roadmap.  This program
       is only used to prepare the map files and is not
       needed when running roadmap.

   : buildus
       buildus takes a set of roadmap map files and creates a
       directory file that lets roadmap choose the map(s) to
       display according to location or city.  buildus is not
       needed when using roadmap -- only when preparing the
       maps.

   : rdmgenmaps
       A script to simplify the generation of the maps.

   : dumpmap
       Display the data tables from a map file.  This application is used
       for debug purposes only and is not needed when using roadmap.

       A RoadMap map file is a small database of C tables.  The tables are
       organized in a tree fashion and each table is identified by a path. 
       One specific set of tables (the dictionary) groups all the names
       that appear in the map.

       dumpmap can be used to display information extracted from a map file:
```
       dumpmap [--usage] [-d TABLE] [--strings] [--volume=NAME] [--search=NAME]
```
       The name of map files must be provided after the options:  dumpmap
       will process each provided file sequentially, according to the
       options that was selected.

       See the "Map Format" section of the documentation for more
       information about the format of the maps.
