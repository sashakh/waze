RoadMap Configuration

January 2009

= Configuration =

     This section describes the files used to configure RoadMap on the local
     machine.  In most cases these files contain user-defined data that
     defines the look of the RoadMap user interface, or resources used by
     RoadMap.

     For more information on configuring specific devices (e.g., WinCE,
     iPhone, XO laptop), see the PLATFORM SPECIFIC section of the
     documentation.

     We will first describe where to find these configuration files on the
     different operating systems that RoadMap supports, then we will describe
     the content of each configuration file.

     The files themselves are the same on all operating systems.

     Note that this section does not cover the files describing the maps:
     there is a clear separation in RoadMap between the map data, which the
     user normally does not modify or customize, and the configuration data,
     which the user may want to custimize.  The map files are described in a
     separate section.

     The configuration files are stored in a set of directories to allow for
     a default, system-wide configuration and allow each user to customize
     the configuration separately.  See the INSTALLATION section of the
     documentation for more details.

== Files ==

     The syntax of most RoadMap configuration files is similar to the X
     ressources file format (the exceptions are the sprites file and the
     trip files). Each configuration item is represented by one line of text,
     using the following format:

```
              name ': ' value
```

     The following configuration files are used:

       : preferences
            User's preferences.

       : session
            The latest context used (locations)

       : sprites
            The definition of the graphic symbols

       : roadmap.toolbar //(Optional)//
            The actions shown on the RoadMap toolbar.

       : roadgps.toolbar //(Optional)//
            The actions shown on the RoadGps toolbar.

     The session file contains the current state of roadmap, which is saved
     (if needed) when roadmap exits.  The preferences file contains all of the
     static preference items, and can be edited by the user.  The sprites
     file contains the graphical definition of the symbols usd by RoadMap to
     indicates the various locations, to draw the compass, etc..

     The toolbar files define the content of the RoadMap and RoadGps toolbars.
     See the section CONFIGURING THE MENUS AND TOOLBAR for more information.

  - CLASS FILES AND SKINS

     The RoadMap configuration also contains the map class files. Each class
     file describes the organization of one set of map files showing the same
     list of layers (roads, topography, water feature, etc...).

     The class files are stored in a skin subdirectory. It is possible to
     install multiple sets of class files by creating multiple skin
     subdirectories and then select the active skin in the user preference.
     The default skin is named, well, "default".

     The class files are described in more details in the MAP FORMAT section.

     (Note that the class files replace the old //schema// file, which is no
     longer used.)

== Messages ==

     The RoadMap text displays and voice messages can be configured by the
     user using format strings in the preferences. The format strings contain
     static and dynamic parts. The dynamic parts (or "%-macros") are specified
     using the character '%' followed by one character that denotes a predefined
     RoadMap variable.

     | %A | Estimated time of arrival (not yet implemented).
     | %B | Direction of travel (bearing).
     | %C | The name of the city for the selected or current street.
     | %D | Distance to the destination (set only when a trip is active).
     | %E | Next sunset time (evening), undefined in night time.
     | %e | Next sunset time, always defined.
     | %F | Full name (number, name, city) of the selected or current street.
     | %H | Altitude.
     | %M | Next sunrise time (morning), undefined in daylight time.
     | %m | Next sunrise time, always defined.
     | %N | Name of the selected or current street.
     | %P | Name of the selected or current place.
     | %R | Name of the route or list containing the selected place.
     | %S | Speed.
     | %T | Current time, format HH:MM.
     | %W | Distance to the next waypoint (set only when a trip is active).
     | %X | Directions to be followed when the next waypoint (with
     |    | directions) is reached. (set only when a trip is active).
     | %Y | Distance to the next waypoint which includes directions, unless
     |    | the GPS is "at" that waypoint.  (set only when a trip is active).
     | %# | the street number range to the selected or current street block.
     | %s | Total number of satellites.
     | %v | Total number of available satellites.
     | %x | Distance from one side of the screen to the other.
     | %y | Distance from the top to the bottom of the screen.

     Note that the time is always shown using the military format: HH:MM.

     Example: "%D (%W)" shows the distance to the destination point, followed
     by the distance to the next waypoint (in parenthesis).

     A message is evaluated, and displayed, only when all referenced %-macros
     have a defined value.  Therefore the example above will show nothing if
     there is no trip active, or if there is no next waypoint.  It is
     possible to define several alternatives, separated by the character '|':
     the first alternative that has been successfully evaluated will be
     displayed.

     Example:  "%D (%W)|%D" shows both distances to the destination point and
     to the next waypoint if both distances are defined, or else only the
     distance to the destination point if this distance is defined.  If none
     of the two distance have been defined (for example when no trip is
     active), then no display is shown and/or no sound is produced.

     Likewise, "In %Y, %X|%X" will say something like "In 0.5 miles, Turn
     Right", unless you're already at the point at which you should turn
     right.  Then it will just say "Turn Right".

     Another typical example is "sunset: %E|sunrise: %M", which shows the
     next sunset (in daylight time) or sunrise (in night time).

     It is possible to "link" together parts of a string using simple or
     double quotes.  This is used when the string specifies an external
     command to execute.  RoadMap does not use the shell to execute commands
     (so to stay independent from the OS-specific shell syntax), but it does
     recognise the use of quotes to specify a command parameter that includes
     spaces.  Such a parameter may be enclosed in single or double quotes.
     There is no difference between one quote or another, except that the
     parameter must be terminated with the same quote character it was
     started with.

     Example: "flite -t 'On %N'" to specify the command flite with two
     parameters ("-f" and "On %N").


== Menus and Toolbar ==

     The items shown in the RoadMap and RoadGps menus and toolbars can be
     redefined by the user in text configuration files.  Note that each
     program comes with a built-in menus and toolbar configuration that
     serves as the default, so none of these configuration files is required
     to be present for RoadMap or RoadGps to work.  In fact, RoadMap is
     distributed with none of the configuration files described in this
     section.  (Example files are provided for RoadMap, but are not installed
     automatically.)

     It must be realized that making any change to the menus and the toolbar
     comes at a price:  this documentation was written using the standard
     user interface.  Modifying the user interface is likely to make this
     documentation even more confusing than it originally is.

     The major reason for customizing the menus or the toolbar is to let
     the user tailor the toolbar to fill small screens (such as a PDA) with
     his preferred controls at the most convenient place. Using a GUI in
     a car or on a bike is challenging enough.

     The configuration files are organized with one entity per line. An
     entity is either the title of a menu, the name of an action, a separator
     or a comment.

     Each menu is described by it's title (prefixed with character '/'),
     followed by the list of items in that menu. The title of a menu is
     a user-defined string with a maximum length of 254 characters (it is
     recommended to select short titles made of a single word, however).
     There is no such title line for toolbars: all menu title lines will be
     silently ignored. The toolbar is organized as a single, anonymous, menu.

     Each menu or toolbar item is described by its action name. A separator is
     described by the character '-'. There must be only one item (title, action
     name or separator) per line. Empty lines are authorized  and lines starting
     with the '#' character are treated as comments.

     There are two sorts of menus.  All menus are available as popup menus,
     which are invoked either in response to an event (as specified in the
     preferences "Events" section), or by being invoked from a menu entry or
     toolbar button.  In addition, menus that are specified as menubar menus
     will appear in the menu bar.  Invoking a popup menu from another menu is
     how submenus are implemented in RoadMap.

     The menus, popup and toolbar configuration files for roadmap are named
     "roadmap.menus", "roadmap.popup" and "roadmap.toolbar", respectively.
     The same configuration files for roadgps are named "roadgps.menus",
     "roadgps.popup" and "roadgps.toolbar". These files must be stored in
     the same places as other RoadMap configuration files.

     By default, a long click of mouse button 1 will bring up the menu called
     "/Long Click Popup" in road{map,gps}.popup, and a right click (button 3)
     will bring up the menu called "/Right Click Popup".  These bindings can be
     changed by setting "Events:Long Click" or "Events:Right Click" in the
     preferences.

     There is a different list of possible actions for RoadMap and RoadGps.
     The list of valid action names can be obtained using the command line
     option --help=actions:

```
          roadmap --help=actions
          roadgps --help=actions
```

     The following is an example of a menus definition file for RoadMap:

```
         /Right Click Popup
         preferences
         gpsconsole
         -
         quit
         /Help
         about
```

     The following is an example of a toolbar definition file for RoadMap:

```
          full
          quit
          -
          destination
          location
          gps
          hold
          -
          zoomin
          zoomout
          zoom1
          ->Help...
```
     The last item in the toolbar file example will invoke the "Help..." menu.
     If the toolbar file is empty, no toolbar will be created.

     It's actually possible to configure RoadMap with no on-screen buttons or
     menus at all.  By creating an empty "roadmap.menus" file, the internal
     menubar menus will be suppressed.  Then, configure the Long or Right Click
     action to invoke the "Menus..." menu.  This special popup contains the same
     list of menus that would normally appear in the menubar.  This allows full
     access to RoadMap commands, all via the mouse.  More practically, one might
     wish to bind the "->Menus..." popup menu to a toolbar button -- then
     RoadMap could run with a toolbar, but no menubar.

     It is also possible to rename the RoadMap actions, with the effect of
     changing the labels used in the menus and the text of the tooltips.

     The translations are described in text files, one text file per program:
     "roadmap.actionlabels" for roadmap and "roadgps.actionlabels" for
     roadgps.  These files should be located in the usual RoadMap
     configuration places.

     Each action is renamed using one line of text that contains the action
     name, its menu label, its toolbar label and its tip label (in that
     order).  Each of these items is separated by one special character.
     This separator can be any character except a letter (upper case or lower
     case) or a digit ('0' to '9').  Different separators can be used on
     different lines, but a single line must use a single separator character.

     The following are examples of valid action renaming lines (from English to
     French, to please our Canadian friends):

```
        mutevoice;Silencieux;S;Desactive la synthese vocale
        enablevoice+Volubile+V+Active la synthese vocale
        quit,Quitter,Q,Quitter l'application
```

     (This mechanism is not intended to provide a general mechanism for the
     internationalization of RoadMap.)

     Remember that the toolbar labels should be very short, since the toolbar
     has a limited size.

== On-Screen Objects ==

     RoadMap can display small images on the screen (on-screen objects) which
     can reflect the state of the program (e.g., which way is north, how strong
     is the GPS signal), and/or allow actions to be performed (e.g.  zoom in,
     show the trip's destination).  These objects may be placed anywhere on the
     screen, but nothing prevents them from being obscured by other popup
     messages and displays, so their position is usually along the sides of the
     screen.

     The position, display, and actions associated with these objects are
     controlled by a "roadmap.screenobjects" file.  The distributed copy of this
     file contains definitions for a small compass image, a map download
     indicator, zoom in and zoom out control points, and some arrow indicators
     which help point the way when following a route.  The user is free
     to make a local copy of this file in order to add on-screen command
     points, and to customize the display in general.

     The roadmap.screenobjects file is made of a sequence of single-line
     commands.  The "sprites" referred to in this description are defined
     in the configuration file named "sprites", described in the "SPRITES FILE"
     section of the documentation.

     | N <name>               |  Name of the object (unused, but starts
     |                        |  a new object)
     | P <x> <y>              |  The screen position of the sprite, measured
     |                        |  from the top left in pixels.  Negative offsets
     |                        |  measure from the right and from the bottom.  If
     |                        |  the <x> or <y> value begins with a 'C', then
     |                        |  the remainder is an offset from the center of
     |                        |  the screen.
     | E <sprite> [text]      |  The name of the sprite which will be drawn.
     | E <sprite> [text]      |  Multiple sprites can be specified.  Which
     |                        |  one is displayed is selected via the object's
     |                        |  "state" indicator.  If "text" is specified, it
     |                        |  will be displayed with the sprite (assuming the
     |                        |  sprite has been defined to have text associated
     |                        |  with it).
     |                        |  - The text can be divided into multiple lines.
     |                        |    Line breaks are indicated by inserting a '^'.
     |                        |  - The text can contain %-macros, just as defined
     |                        |    for other text displays, in order to display
     |                        |    dynamic content.  The '|' "alternation" symbol
     |                        |    is also honored.  See the "CONFIGURING THE
     |                        |    TEXT AND VOICE MESSAGES" section of the
     |                        |    documentation.
     | S <statename>          |  The "state" indicator which will choose among
     |                        |  the listed sprites.  For "constant" displays,
     |                        |  this is optional.
     | A <actionname>         |  The action which should be invoked when the
     |                        |  sprite is selected.  Optional.  The action can
     |                        |  be a simple action name, or, when prefixed with
     |                        |  "-->", the name of a popup menu which should
     |                        |  be invoked.
     | R                      |  Sprites will normally rotate, either with the
     |                        |  screen, or based on an angle retrieved via
     |                        |  the state indicator.  Specifying 'R' suppresses
     |                        |  this by forcing rotation to the given angle.
     | B <x> <y> <x> <y>      |  Optional -- the bounding box used to determine
     |                        |  whether a selection has taken place.  (I.e.,
     |                        |  the size of the sprite.) Normally the bounding
     |                        |  box is calculated by RoadMap itself (and if
     |                        |  the object will rotate, the bounding box is
     |                        |  forced to have maximal dimensions), but
     |                        |  irregularly shaped sprites, combined with the
     |                        |  rotation of the sprite, may require that the
     |                        |  box be overridden.  Note that the bounding box
     |                        |  of any text associated with the sprite is
     |                        |  calculated and considered separately.

     The screen objects can display different sprites to indicate the state of
     various internaly RoadMap runtime states.  These state indicators are
     referenced by name, and are linked to the screen object via the 'S'
     descriptor in the "roadmap.screenobjects" file.

     The possible state indicators are as follows.  Most have just two possible
     "return values", but some can represent more than two state values.  In
     addition, any can optionally return an angle which can influence the
     display of the sprite.

     |  get_download_enabled  | Indicates whether the user has enabled
     |                        | map downloads.
     |  get_GPS_reception     | Four possible states, indicating current GPS
     |                        | performace:  N/A, none, poor, and good.
     |  zoom_reset            | Indicates whether zoom is at the default level.
     |  view_mode             | Indicates 2D or 3D map rendering.
     |  get_orientation       | Indicates whether map rotation is fixed or
     |                        | dynamic.  Also returns the current angle of
     |                        | the map relative to north.  (This is what
     |                        | drives the on-screen compass object.)
     |  get_direction_next    | When following a route, indicates the direction
     |                        | to the next waypoint.  This indication is
     |                        | relative to the direction of travel -- i.e., it
     |                        | points correctly if the user holding the display
     |                        | is facing forward in the vehicle.
     |  get_direction_2nd     | As above, but points to the waypoint after the
     |                        | next.
     |  get_direction_dest    | As above, but points to the final destination.

  - A NOTE REGARDING COLORS

     Some RoadMap configuration items define colors to be used. As a general
     rule a color must be described in a way that is suitable for the target
     graphic system.

     In the case of X11, that means either a color name (as defined in the
     /etc/X11/rgb.txt) or a color definition: #rrggbb where rr, gg and bb
     are hexadecimal values (for example: #FFFFFF is white, #000000 is black).

     Note that the #rrggbb format is broadly supported, even on target systems
     that do not support named colors.


== Preference Items ==

     : General.Unit
         The unit system used, either "imperial" or "metric"
          - //Default:// imperial

     : General.Default Zoom
         The zoom level when roadmap is started.
          - //Format:// integer
          - //Default:// 60

     : General.Keyboard
         Show (yes) or hide (no) a keyboard on the screen.
          - //Format:// boolean
          - //Default:// yes

     : General.Icons
         Show (yes) or hide (no) icons on the toolbar.
          - //Format:// boolean
          - //Default:// yes
          - //Command line option:// --no-icon

     : General.IconPath
         The icon search path.
          - //Format:// a comma-separated list of directory paths.
          - //Default:// see the ICON FILES section of this document.
          - //Comment:// The hardcoded default includes the usual linux system
                       pixmap directories used for storing application icons.
                       A "pixmaps" subdirectory of the user's .roadmap
                       directory, and the system roadmap config directory,
                       will also be searched.

     : General.Busy Cursor Delay
         Delay until mouse cursor switches to "busy"
          - //Format:// integer (milliseconds)
          - //Default:// 200
          - //Comment:// When displaying maps that cover a large area, or on
                       a slow computer, a screen refresh may take some time.
                       The mouse will change to a "watch" or hourglass or other
                       busy indicator after this amount of time.  Use '0' to
                       disable this.

     : General.Progress Bar Delay
         Delay until progress bar during refresh.
          - //Format:// integer (milliseconds)
          - //Default:// 350
          - //Comment:// When displaying maps that cover a large area, or on
                       a slow computer, it may be helpful to have an on-screen
                       indication of how long the refresh will take.  The
                       value is the delay until the progress bar appears.  Use
                       '0' to disable the progress bar.  It may be desirable
                       to disable the progress bar especially if the X window
                       manager insists on making the progress dialog fullscreen,
                       or if it always takes focus away from roadmap (in which
                       case keystrokes will go to the progress bar dialog
                       box instead of roadmap).

     : General.Show Errors

                       to the postmortem file (and to stderr, if available),
                       but this preference item controls whether the user
                       will see them in a dialog box on the screen.

     : General.Toolbar

                       or minimize the toolbar if a very small screen is
                       needed, because the size of the toolbar may dicate
                       the minimum size of the screen.  The toolbar can also
                       be eliminated by creating an empty "roadmap.toolbar"
                       file.

     : General.Toolbar Orientation

          - //Comment:// Trips files can be stored anywhere, but in some places
                       RoadMap makes it easier if they're stored here.  New
                       trips, unnamed by the users will be stored here.

                       standard locations for the maps in previous versions of
                       RoadMap.  Maps can be located in any directory mentioned
                       in this path.  RoadMap will only consult a single
                       usdir.rdm file at a time, even if more than one is
                       present in the Map.Path directories.

     : Map.Cache
         The number of entries in RoadMap's mapping cache.
          - //Format:// integer
          - //Default:// 8

          - //Format:// enumeration (off / labels / signs / all)
          - //Default:// labels
          - //Comment:// The internal line font may be preferable to the system
                   font since it can draw at angles, and since its size can be
                   easily scaled.  It is not very pretty, however.

         The algorithm used to decide when to store a new trackpoint
         - //Format:// enumeration ("off", "Deviation", "Distance", "Time")
         - //Default:// off
         - //Comment:// When "off", no track is recorded.  When set to "Time",
                   a new trackpoint is stored after "Track.Time Delta" time
                   has passed since the last point was recorded.  Shen set to
                   "Distance Delta", a new point is stored when the user has
                   moved Track.Distance from the last point.  "Deviation" is
                   the optimal setting:  call the most recent three points A,
                   B, and C.  Point B is dropped if the distance from A to B
                   and then to C is approximately equal to the distance
                   directly from A to C.

     : Track.Time Delta

         - //Format:// integer
         - //Default:// 1000
         - //Comment:// After "Track.Autosave minutes", if there are 25%
                   more points in the current track than this number, then
                   75% are saved to an archive file, and the remainder
                   are still kept in memory and displayed on the map.

     : Trip.GPS Focus Release Delay
         Delay until GPS loses focus, if off-screen.
         - //Format:// integer (seconds)
         - //Default:// 5 seconds
         - //Comment:// If the GPS is being tracked, and the map is moved so
                   that the GPS is no longer visible, the map will continue
                   to move relative to the GPS for the specified number of
                   seconds.  After this, the focus will "hold" to the current
                   location.  A value of zero (0) will force tracking to
                   continue forever -- the minimum actual delay is 1 second.

     : FeatureFiles.Path
         List of files containing "Point of Interest" features
             to display on map.
         - //Format:// A comma-separated list of featurefile specifiers.
                   A featurefile specifier is a semi-colon-separated list of

         - //Comment:// The filename may include & and ~ as path shorthands.
                   The spritename should appear in the sprites file.  The
                   labelcolor will be used when writing the feature's name.
                   The label and sprite levels are integers, representing the
                   zoom level above which the label or sprite, respectively,
                   will not be drawn.  Either the sprite name or the label
                   color may be the string "NONE", which will suppress the
                   sprite or the label, respectively.  Either declutter level
                   may be omitted.

     : Files.Make Backups
         Enable/disable the creation of backup files.
         - //Format:// boolean
         - //Default:// yes
         - //Comment:// On UNIX, backup files will have a '~' character
                   appended.  Under Windows, a ".bak" suffix will be used.

     : GPS.Background
         The background color for the RoadGps screen.

     : GPS.Timeout
         A timeout for detecting that the GPS link is down.
         - //Format:// number of seconds.
         - //Default:// 10
         - //Comment:// The GPS link is considered down if no new GPS data was
                   received for the specified amount of time.  Note that the
                   GPS status will also go "down" because the GPS has lost
                   satellite visibility. This timeout simply forces that
                   status if communication with the GPS receiver is lost.

     : GPS.LostFixWarningTimeout
         Timeout for the "lost satellite" message.
         - //Format:// number of seconds.
         - //Default:// 10000
         - //Comment:// If the satellite link is lost, RoadMap will alert the
                   user with a popup message.  The message can be dismissed
                   manually.  It will also go away when satellite communication
                   is restored.  This timeout controls how long the message
                   will remain up if neither of those things happen.  A setting
                   of 0 disables the popup message altogether.

     : GPS.Source
         The URL that gives the address of the GPS data source.
         - //Format:// <protocol>:<description>
         - //Default:// gpsd://localhost
         - //Comment:// The gpsd protocol (gpsd://<hostname>[:<port>]) uses
                   the NMEA raw mode of gpsd, while the gpsd2 protocol
                   (gpsd2://<hostname>[:<port>]) uses the gpsd native protocol.
                   The object protocol (object:<id>) makes it possible to use
                   an internal RoadMap object as GPS source (so that a driver
                   can feed the GPS position to RoadMap).  The file protocol
                   (file://<path>) is also possible, for debug.  If gpsd is not
                   available, one can use a GPS source connected directly to a
                   serial port.  (tty://<device-path>[:baudrate])  An example
                   would be "tty://dev/ttyS0", or "COM1:" under Windows.  4800
                   baud is the NMEA standard, but a different speed can be
                   given:  "tty://dev/ttyS0:19200".  (Note that using direct
                   tty access prevents one from running both RoadMap and
                   RoadGps at the same time, since there is no mechanism in
                   place to allow sharing the serial port.  Using gpsd is
                   recommended.)

     : GPS.Baud
         The baud rate to use if GPS.Source is a serial port
         - //Format:// integer

== Schema Items ==

     The schema file uses the same format as the preference file. It defines
     the properties of the various categories of objects that make a map.
     the list of categories matches the list of Tiger file's categories
     (see Tiger's CFCC field) that have been filtered by buildmap.

     The two differences with the preferences files are that there is no
     pre-defined category in RoadMap: categories are defined by the maps
     (FIXME: this is still to be done--as a temporary hack, the categories
     have been hardcoded somewhere) and there is no default value.

     For each category, RoadMap use the following items:

     : <category>.Class:
        the class of object this category belongs to.
        - //Format:// Road, Feature or Area.
        - //Comment:// Road and Feature categories are searched in the "line"
                  table of the map files and drawn as lines. The Road
                  category is searched when a street name is looked for.
                  The Area objects are drawn separatly, as polygons.

     : <category>.Color:
        the color used when drawing the objects.
        - //Format:// color

     : <category>.Declutter:
        the zoom level from which the objects are hidden
        - //Format:// integer
        - //Comment:// The definition of this item is rather obscure. To be fixed.

     : <category>.Thickness:
        the thickness used to draw lines.
        - //Format:// number of pixels


     RoadMap uses the following categories:

        - Freeways
        - Ramps
        - Highways
        - Streets
        - Trails
        - Rivers
        - Shore
        - Hospitals
        - Malls
        - Airports
        - Stations
        - Lakes
        - Parks
        - Sea

== Sprites ==

     This file defines the drawing commands used to draw the various symbols
     used by RoadMap:

         - GPS (indicates the current GPS position and direction),
         - Position (indicates the currently selected location),
         - Destination,
         - Highlight (marks the endpoints of a selected street block) and
         - Compass (used to indicates the direction of the North pole).

     The sprites file is made of a sequence of single-line commands:

     | S <name>              | Starts a sprite.
     | A <name>              | Defines the current sprite as an alias of
     |                       | the specified sprite.
     | F <color> <thickness> | Define the pen to be used by the subsequent
     |                       | drawing commands.
     | X <percent>           | Optional scale factor for this sprite.  All
     |                       | components of the sprite will be adjusted.
     | L <x>,<y> ..          | Draw a line.
     | P <x>,<y> ..          | Draw a filled polygon.
     | C <x>,<y> <radius>    | Draw a circle.
     | D <x>,<y> <radius>    | Draw a disk (filled circle).
     | B <x>,<y> <x>,<y>     | Optional -- the bounding box used to determine
     |                       | whether a selection has taken place, when a
     |                       | a sprite is in use as an on-screen object (in
     |                       | "roadmap.screenobjects").  Normally the
     |                       | bounding box is calculated by RoadMap itself,
     |                       | but irregularly shaped sprites, combined with
     |                       | the rotation of the sprite, may require that
     |                       | the box be overridden.
     | T <x>,<y> <s> text... | Adds text to the sprite, of size 's'.  "text"
     |                       | can be ommitted, in cases where the sprite's
     |                       | text will be provided by a screen object
     |                       | definition.  Text strings are fixed, with no
     |                       | expansion of %-macros.
     | TR                    | If the sprite has text, supply a backing
     |                       |   rectangle sized and positioned to match the
     |                       |   text.
     | TB                    | If the sprite has text, supply a box outline
     |                       |   around the text.

     The coordinates are pixel positions, relative to the sprites "hot point".
     The "natural" direction for the sprite, for pointing purposes is to the
     north.  Positive X and Y values are towards the east and south, negative
     are towards the west and north.

     The bounding box of a sprite is normally calculated internally, but can
     be overridden.  If a sprite has text associated with it, the text forms a
     second, separate, bounding box.  This is because the text may change
     shape (if it's dynamically produced), and because sprites tend to be
     compact, while text tends to be long and thin.  Currently these bounding
     box outlines are only used when a sprite is referenced in
     "roadmap.screenobjects".  The sprite's bounding box can also be
     overridden there.

     An S command must appear before any alias or drawing command.

     A sprite cannot contain both an alias command and drawing commands. In
     addition, if an alias command is present, it is the only command defining
     this sprite (i.e. an alias sprite is defined by just one S and one A
     command). For example:

```
     S Friend
     A GreenTriangle

     S GreenTriangle
     F white 2
     L 0,0 7,14 0,8 -7,14
     F DarkGreen 2
     L 0,1 6,13 0,10 -6,13 0,1
```

     A sprite alias is just another name for the referenced sprite: an alias
     will be visually identical to the sprite it references. An alias command
     can reference a sprite that is itself an alias. There is no limit to
     the depth of the alias chain, but circular references are illegal, and
     detected. Forward references are legal, i.e. the sprite referenced in
     an alias command can be defined later in the file.

     One reason for using alias sprites is to make it simpler to redefine
     sprites known to RoadMap (such as "Direction" or "Destination"). The
     alias mechanism has a negligible fixed cost at runtime: using multiple
     alias levels will have no practical impact on RoadMap performances.


== Trip Files ==

     RoadMap trip data is stored in GPX format.  More about the widely-used
     GPX data format can be found at:

        http://www.topografix.com/gpx.asp

     The main thing to know about this format is that a GPX file
     may contain one or more "routes", one or more "tracks", and
     one or more "landmarks".

     Routes and tracks are very similar:  it's most useful to
     think of a route as "where you want to go", and a track as
     "where you've been".  Routes are usually "composed", either
     manually or using navigation software.  Tracks are usually
     recorded, by making a note of one's GPS location
     periodically.  (By the way, tracks don't get included into
     trip files automatically.  If you wish to store your tracks
     along with your routes for a given trip, you'll need to save
     copies of your current track and them to the trip.)

     Routes and tracks are both composed of "waypoints".  To
     reduce confusion, RoadMap tries to use the term "waypoint"
     to _only_ refer to points which are contained in routes and
     tracks.  Points that are unassociated with a specific route
     or track are called "landmarks".  If you read the GPX
     documentation you'll find that everything is called a
     waypoint.

     Waypoints simply represent a place, along with some other
     information about that place.  For instance, a waypoint in a
     route might have a name, and it might also have a comment
     attached to it which says which way to turn when this
     waypoint is reached.  A waypoint in a track might only
     contain its location and the time at which you were there.
     The landmarks in the trip file might represent places of
     interest which, while not really part of a route, are
     related to the trip somehow.

     Here are some more details regarding how RoadMap uses the GPX
     format.

     Waypoints (and landmarks):

        <name> is used directly if available.

        If no name is available, a shortened version of the <cmt>
        or <description> element will be used instead.  If
        neither of these elements is available, a name will be
        generated.

        In addition, if no <cmt> is available, the <description>
        element will be used as a description.

        The <sym> element will be used as the sprite name, if it
        is set, otherwise fixed RoadMap defaults will be used for
        the spritename, depending on what sort of waypoint it is.

        When generating a waypoint while recording a track,
        RoadMap will set the <ele>, <speed>, <course>, and <time>
        elements, as well as the "lat" and "lon" attributes.  All
        of this data comes directly from the GPS.  The <name> and
        <sym> elements are left unset.

    Routes and Tracks:

        The <name> and <desc> elements will be used and set.  For
        tracks, the <trkseg> level of the hierarchy is ignored --
        all track segments are treated as one.

     The following trip file example contains just one route,
     which goes from the Golden Gate's bridge to 1 Market St, in
     san Francisco, California.  It also contains the locations
     of some nearby pizza parlors:

     In addition to the trip files, there are two other important
     files which are also stored in GPX format.

        : Personal Landmarks
          Called "landmarks.gpx" by default, this contains
          landmarks (waypoints) which you might want to keep handy
          no matter what trip file you have loaded.  Examples might
          include your home, your office, your hairdresser, etc.
          When writing this file, only the personal landmarks are
          written.  When reading, only the unassociated waypoints
          are read -- any routes or tracks in the file are ignored.

        : Current Track
          Contains waypoints representing where you've been -- a
          "breadcrumb trail", if you will.  This file (called
          "currenttrack.gpx" by default) will only contain a single
          track when written.  When read (on startup, to restore
          previous state), only the first track in the file will be
          read.  All other routes or tracks and waypoints will be
          ignored (and likely lost, when the current track is saved
          at the end of the session).  Along with the
          currenttrack.gpx, you may see "recenttrack.csv", and one
          or more "savetrack-*.gpx" files (which will include a
          date in their names).  The "savetrack" files are archival:
          if the in-memory list gets too big, or if the user
          "clears" the current track, then excess historical
          trackpoints will be written to a "savetrack" file.  A
          "savetrack" file will also be created if you manually
          reset the current track -- a backup of its contents is
          saved, for good measure.  The "recenttrack.csv" file is a
          temporary file, used to keep RoadMap from losing any
          track points in the event that it dies (crashes)
          unexpectedly.  The goal is to never lose a track point.

     (These files are not stored in the same directory as the other
     trip files, but instead in the same directory in which the
     user's preferences and session file are found.)


== Feature Files ==

     Like the RoadMap trip data, feature data is stored in GPX format.  Each
     feature file should represent a related set of points of interest, like
     ice cream shops, motels, campgrounds, or mountaintops.  A single sprite
     can be associated with each file, and will be used to represent its
     contents on the map.  Features will be labeled using the pen color
     specified.  Either or both of the sprite and label can be suppressed by
     specifying the name "NONE".  Feature labels and sprites can also be
     selectively disabled as the map is zoomed out.  An example feature file
     specification, which uses ';' as its delimiter, might be:
        &/icecream.gpx;ConeSprite;darkblue;350;750
     This says that the ice cream shops listed in the given file should
     be drawn with the ConeSprite, labeled with a "darkblue" pen, the labels
     should be eliminated above zoom level 350, and the sprites should
     disappear above zoom 750.  Likewise:
        &/towns.gpx;NONE;black;350;350
     says that towns should be labeled in black, with no sprite, up to
     zoom level 350.  If a higher sprite declutter level is specified:
        &/towns.gpx;NONE;black;350;1000
     then a small default sprite (with the name "PointOfInterest") will be
     shown, up to the higher level.

     Multiple file specifications (including each file's associated (and
     semicolon-separated) sprite name, pen color, and declutter levels)
     should be separated by ',' characters.

     Note that unlike the maps, which are read and cached on an as-needed
     basis, the feature files are read into memory in their entirety when
     RoadMap starts, so there is a memory penalty for using large feature
     files.
